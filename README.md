Hierarchical_model_of_NBA_score

## `NBA score, implementation of pymc` is inspired by  [Deneil Weitzenfeld's](http://danielweitzenfeld.github.io/passtheroc/blog/2014/10/28/bayes-premier-league/) blog. 

### I am interested in implementing the same hierarchical Bayesian model to NBA. The first attribution to capture offense and defense is the score in each game. 
### Data is from ESPN scoreboard season 2015-2016.
### Many things happened in the summer 2016, so I don't think this data could have much predictive value, but we could always start with something easy, couldn't we?

## `NBA get score from bball refrence` has the same model but different data source.

## Plans in the future: wish to add more features in the model for better prediction.
